Weavly has incorporated settings to support keyboard users. Keyboard accessibility can impact experiences of many different groups of users including those with motor disabilities, blind users, and individuals who choose to work with keyboards because of preference or efficiency. 

Prior to using Weavly’s coding environment, consider the following features and tips to provide a more accessible coding experience for learners who use keyboards.

## Navigation

Learners are able to fully navigate Weavly’s coding environment and operate its different functionalities by using a regular keyboard. Here is an overview of the keys they can use:

* Press “Tab” key to go to the next interactive item in the Weavly coding environemnt.
* Press “Shift” + “Tab” keys to go back to the previous interactive item in the Weavly coding environemnt.
* Press “Spacebar” or “Enter” to select an item.
* Use arrow keys to move between the options on a menu.
