Weavly has incorporated keyboard equivalents in its interface to allow for access through the use of digital onscreen keyboards, such as Grid 3 or Communicator 5. Educators can integrate Weavly keyboard shortcuts to set up these communication tools and enable learners with significant physical needs to use Weavly’s coding environment.  

To set up these onscreen keyboards, we encourage educators to work with the learners and their trusted care partners, such as parents or teachers, to understand how to navigate digital interfaces and use assistive technologies, such as sip and puff or single/multiple switches. 

## Navigation

### Weavly’s keyboard shortcuts

There is a setting for enabling keyboard shortcuts in the Weavly coding environment. The switch scanning navigation can use a combination of keyboard shortcuts to minimize the number of switch interactions and physical movements required.

Here is a full list of keyboard shortcuts that are available for Weavly: [](https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/main/docs/keyboard.md)

### Scanning

To increase ease of scanning and navigation efficiency, the items on Weavly can be grouped for row-column scanning. In this table, we have provided the commands, the keyboard shortcuts that are associated with them, as well as the visuals that can be used to build the onscreen keyboards.
