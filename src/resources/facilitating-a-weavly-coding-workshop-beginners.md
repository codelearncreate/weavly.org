# Introduction to Coding

To begin, give an understanding of what coding is and how it is used in the learners’ life. This introduction will help provide context of what the Weavly coding environment can offer.

> ***A script to say to learners:***\
> *We use coding to talk to computers. To make sure they do exactly what we want, we have to give them very clear and step by step instructions.There are so many different kinds of computers around us and we constantly give them different instructions.*

Offer examples using familiar devices that have a computer and use coding, such as elevators, microwaves, washing machines, etc. Facilitator can show several different image pairings to learners and ask them to identify which ones are a computer and need clear instruction and programming.

> *Microwave: When using a microwave, there are different options that can be selected to adjust the timing of food you want to heat up and then boom! It starts following your instructions and heating up your food exactly the way you want it.*

# Weavly Demo

## Overview

Provide an overview of the Weavly user interface to help orient learners before they start building a program. As you describe each part, highlight that section in the Weavly coding environment. 

> *A script to say to learners:*
>
> *This program has 3 main parts. These three parts work together to help you build a program. With a program you can move your character on the screen.*
>
> 1. *The first part is the scene where you can see your character move.*
>
> *\[Add screenshot]* 
>
> 2. *The second part is the actions panel that gives different action blocks like forward, backward, turn right or turn left.* 
>
> *\[Add screenshot]* 
>
> 3. *The third part is the program panel that gives you a place to put together different action blocks and build a program to move your character on the scene.* 
>
> *\[Add screenshot]*

Screen reader users can use heading or landmark navigation to go to any of these sections. Keyboard users can use the ‘Tab’ key to move to these sections. 

### Customizing the environment

Before the learners begin to build a program, encourage them to try different accessibility options to set up an environment that they prefer and enjoy using. There are visual themes that change the colour scheme of Weavly and audio settings that can adjust how sounds are incorporated. For screen reader users: The audio feature is recommended to be turned off.

As you talk about each menu, try different options on your screen to show learners how the affect Weavly. 

A script to say to learners:

1. #### Visual themes

You have a few colour options for Weavly. Give each option a try and decide on one that you would like. You can always go back here and change your selection.

2. #### Audio setting

You can choose to turn on/off different sounds in Weavly. Give the toggle a try and decide if you would like to keep this on or off. You can always come back here and turn this feature on/off. 

3. #### World selector

You can also pick different backgrounds for your scene. Move your focus to the World selector tool and try to select the one you would like.

## Play Area

### Scene

The scene includes a grid of 12 columns and 8 rows. The grid layout supports learners in positioning their character on the scene. This information can also help with planning a path towards a specific grid cell as they build a program. The grid cells also include information about the visuals they include. This information can be communicated through screen readers to support learners who do not have access to the visual information on the scene.  

As your character moves around the scene, a line can be drawn when the Pen Down feature located in the scene settings (right side of scene) is turned on. This Pen Down feature helps learners to focus their attention on tracking the movement of the character along with the program they have built.

A script to say to learners:

The “Scene” is where your character gets to move and play. This scene is made of a grid that has 12 columns and 8 rows. The columns are labeled by alphabet letters from A-L and the rows are numbered 1-8. In your scene, you have a character. Right now, it is on the top left corner of your grid – on Column A, Row 2. We call its location as A-2. Your character looks like a Robot right now.

### Action Blocks

Currently, there are two different types of action blocks available on Weavly. 

1. #### Movement

The first type includes action blocks for movement. These action blocks include:

* Moving forward by 1 square;
* Moving backward by 1 square;
* Turning right by 45 degrees;
* Turning right by 90 degrees;
* Turning left by 45 degrees; and 
* Turning left by 90 degrees.

2. #### Controls

The second type of action blocks are controls. These controls give conditions to change how action blocks behave. Currently there is only the loop feature available under the control blocks that can be further explored in the Facilitation Guide for Advanced/Experienced Coders \[Provide a link]

Learners can select one action block at a time and then add it to their program to build a sequence of actions. 

A script to say to learners:

If we want our character to go to any specific grid cell, we have to give it clear instructions. We can do this by choosing the right action blocks from the action panel. There are different groups of action blocks to choose from.

Here are the available actions blocks

* An action block for moving your character Forward one square
* An action block for moving your character backward one square
* An action block for turning your character Right 45 degrees (This option helps you draw diagonal lines)
* An action block for turning your character Right 90 degrees 
* An action block for turning your character Left 45 degrees (This option helps you draw diagonal lines)
* An action block for turning your character Left 90 degrees
* An action block to build loops (This option helps you repeat a part of your program)

## How to build a program

Here is an example of how to build a program with the available action blocks in the Weavly coding environment. To create a square on the scene, challenge the learner to move the on-screen character starting from grid cell A2 and returning to grid cell A2.

A script to say to learners:

Let’s make a square using the action blocks.

1. Select the ‘Move Forward 1 square’ action block, and then the ‘+’ button at the end of your program to add.
2. Select the ‘Turn Right 90 degrees’ action block, and then the ‘+’ button at the end of your program to add.
3. Select the ‘Move Forward 1 square’ action block, and then the ‘+’ button at the end of your program to add.
4. Select the ‘Turn Right 90 degrees’ action block, and then the ‘+’ button at the end of your program to add.
5. Select the ‘Move Forward 1 square’ action block, and then the ‘+’ button at the end of your program to add.
6. Select the ‘Turn Right 90 degrees’ action block, and then the ‘+’ button at the end of your program to add.
7. Select the ‘Move Forward 1 square’ action block, and then the ‘+’ button at the end of your program to add.
8. Select the ‘Turn Right 90 degrees’ action block, and then the ‘+’ button at the end of your program to add.

## How to play your program

The play controls (bottom) includes buttons to play, pause, or stop the program. There are options to adjust the program playback speed and to refresh the scene. 

Once learners are ready to try their program, they can press the “Play” button to make their character move based on the program they have built. Make sure the Pen Down feature (toggle in the scene settings on the right side) is enabled, if you want your character to draw a line as it moves on the scene according to your program. 

A script to say to learners:

Once you have added your action blocks, you can play, pause and stop the program that you created. As your program is being played, your character will move in the scene. To track your character as it moves, choose the Pen Down (in your scene settings; toggle on the Right panel) feature to allow your robot to draw a line as it moves around the scene.

## Editing your program

As learners add action blocks to their program and play it, they may realize that their program doesn’t work according to what they have planned. They may want to edit their program. This process is called debugging in programming. Once an action block is added to a program, learners can select that action block to open up an edit menu to make changes to the selected action block. On the edit menu, they have these four options:

* Delete action block
* Replace action block
* Move action block one step to left
* Move action block one step to right

Learners also have the option to delete the entire program and start over. When learners encounter an unintended result (e.g. character is moving in the wrong direction), encourage learners to problem solve by asking them to stop and talk to them about different ways that they can “debug” their program.  

A script to say to learners:

If your character is not doing what you want it to do, there are different ways that you can fix this. Programmers call this “Debugging”. 

\[Add screenshot]

Select the action blocks that you think are causing the problem. An edit menu will pop up with options. On the menu, there is a “Trash can” that you can use to delete that action block. 

\[Add screenshot]

The second option on this edit menu is “Replace”. You can use this option to replace your current action block with a different action block. For example if your current action block is Turn Right 90 degrees, you can use the “Replace” option to switch to Turn Left 90 degrees or any other action block. 

\[Add screenshot]

If you think the placement of your action block is in the wrong order, you can use the “Move Left” and “Move Right” buttons to move this action block along your program. 

\[Add screenshot]

If none of these options work and you are not sure what is causing the problem, then you want to start from scratch. To start from scratch, you can delete your entire program by selecting the trash icon in your program area (located on top right corner) and then select the “Delete All” button. 

\[Add screenshot]

Refreshing the scene

Every time a program is played, the character executes the program from its current position on the scene. For example, imagine the learner has built a simple program with one “Move forward 1 square” action block. The first time they play it, the character moves from its original spot A2 and lands on B2. The second time they play the same program, their character starts from B2 and lands in C2. If a learner wants to take their character back to its original starting position (A2), they need to press the “Refresh” button before playing their program. 

A script to say to learners:

Did you notice that every time you played your program, your character continued moving from the last spot it was moved to?

If you want to take your character back to its original starting point on the scene, you need to select the “Refresh” button before playing your program. 

## How to share your program

Next to the Play controls (right bottom) is a button to share the created program. Once the ‘Share’ button is selected, a URL link of the built programs is copied automatically. Learners can paste the URL link to share their work with others via email or other social platforms.

A script to say to learners:

To share the program you have built, select the ‘Share’ button in the bottom right corner (in the play region) for a copy of the URL link. You can share this link with your friends.
