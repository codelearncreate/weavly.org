    Weavly is built upon the efforts and contributions of many young and adult
    co-designers, family members, educators, and caregivers over the years.
    Without their insights and dedication, this project would not have been
    possible. Due to privacy reasons, we are unable to list their names here,
    but we are always deeply grateful for their invaluable contributions.


    We would like to acknowledge the individuals and community-based groups who facilitated connections with our co-designers and significantly contributed to the progress of this project.


    If you have contributed to Weavly in any capacity and would like your name to be included, please contact our team at weavly@idrc.ocadu.ca.

goalSection:
  content: Our goal is to empower all learners with diverse abilities to be
    creators of their digital worlds, to express themselves using code and art,
    and to apply these skills to other areas of learning and daily life. Not
    just learning to code, but coding to learn and create.
