## Description

This activity engages learners to recognize events in a story and practice sequencing. Children's stories include simple sequences with which most kids are familiar. Understanding the logical order of events in a story helps learners to recognize sequences in everyday life. Sequencing is an abstract concept that takes practice to master. This skill development helps build the foundation for block coding.

## Steps

* Pick a story with which the learner may be familiar.
* Show the pictures of events for the story and engage the learner to describe what can be noticed or what is happening.
* Ask the learner how they think the story would occur and order the pictures accordingly.

## Tips

* Try another story that would be funny or engaging for the learner.
* In situations in which the learner does not recognize the missed or misplaced step, perform the activity again in the correct order and explain the correct sequence of actions and events.

## Skill Development

* Observational
* Sequencing
* Communication (i.e. narrative)
