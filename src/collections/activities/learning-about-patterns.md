## Description

This activity requires learners to identify patterns that are being repeated in a sequence. Parents, educators, and moderators can use simple drawings or clipart in a sequence to identify repeated patterns.

Parents and educators can use these sequences as a starting point to practice identifying patterns in a sequence: [Loop Sequences](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U2_xaP9UcmR1Ny-uRp6-d81Zn2taHjte_zW59b5HLcw/edit#slide=id.g562fe6ef27_0_0)

## Steps

* Use the sample sequences to encourage learners to identify the distinct/different items.
* Once the repeated patterns are identified, work with learners to create the next items to continue the repeating patterns.
* Repeat for a new sequence.

## Tips

* Ask learners to think about where they might see patterns in their everyday life.
* Read a picture book that has a clear repeating pattern to connect this concept to other areas of learning. This story gives them a chance to hear a repeating pattern - not just see it. The same could be done for a piece of music or a dance.
* Try to use symbols, pictures, or objects that learners like and prefer (e.g. food, cartoon characters, toys) to motivate players.

## Skill Development

* Pattern Recognition
* Sorting

## Level Up!

Using the same symbols/pictures/drawing/clip-art, ask learners/players to create their own sequence with a repeated pattern.
