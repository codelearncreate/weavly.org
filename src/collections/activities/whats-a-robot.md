## Description

This multi-level activity introduces the concept of robots. Learners can engage in different activities, such as watching videos and or reading picture books, to identify robots in their immediate environment. To introduce robots, our team recommends these resources as they provide details that are fun and engaging:

* Talk to them about their choices.
* Ask each learner to look around in their immediate environment and try to find anything that could be a robot and describe their reasons.
* If there is a robot available, demonstrate building a simple program and making the robot move based on your program.
