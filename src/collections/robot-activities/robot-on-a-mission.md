## Description

In this activity, learners plan and build a path to direct Dash to move to a specific object on a grid map.

## Steps

* Use a taping mask or chalk to build a grid map on the floor.
* Once your grid is ready, place a few items such as toys on different grid cells.
* Select a starting point for Dash and place it on the map.
* Use Weavly to build a sequence to make Dash move to a selected destination on the grid map.
* Play your sequence program.
* Pause your program and debug once Dash starts to move away from the desired destination.

## Tips

* If you are doing this activity on a tabletop or an elevated surface, block the edges to prevent robots from falling.
* You can use any object, draw or write something on the map.
* To make this fun, build a story around the objects on your map and give Dash a specific mission to accomplish.

## Skill Development

* Directional
* Mathematical
* Sequencing
* Spatial

## Level UpÂ 

* Complete this activity again with a planned shape or pattern in mind.
* Restrict the number of cells the robot can move.
