## Description

In this activity, learners can explore different movements and visual and audio options for Sphero. As learners try its different features, they will become familiar with Sphero's control settings. This activity encourages learners to use their sensory abilities to identify cause and effect.

## Steps

* Open SpheroEdu.
* Connect with Sphero robot.
* Open the movement settings.
* Try different distances and speed options.
* Open the light color settings.
* Try different light colors.
* Try different types of lines (e.g. straight vs curved).

## Tips

* Ensure operational batteries are available and Sphero is operational prior to the activity.
* Set up a space with dim light and a relatively quiet environment to detect visual changes.

## Skill Development

* Analytical/Reasoning (cause and effect)
* Creative Thinking
* Directional
* Observational
* Parameters
* Planning
* Sequencing
* Spatial

## Level Up

Complete this activity again with different setting options that were not chosen before, if any are remaining.
