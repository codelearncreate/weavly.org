## Steps

* Open Block.ly or Weavly.
* Connect Block.ly or Weavly to Dash or Dot.
* Use the Block.ly or Weavly blocks to create a sequence for the robot you have connected.
* Find the setting panel for light.
* Select three different light options to see on Dash or Dot.
* Find the setting panel for sound.
* Select three different sound options to see on Dash or Dot.
* Adjust the parameters for your selected blocks, such as changing color or sound.
* Play your sequence to see how Dash or Dot is performing your program.

## Tips

* Ensure batteries are charged and Dash and Dot is operational prior to the activity.
* Set up space with dim light and a relatively quiet environment to detect visual and/or audio changes.

## Skill Development

* Creative Thinking
* Observational
