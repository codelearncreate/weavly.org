title: Open Robot Kit
subtitle: Off the shelf robots are often inaccessible for many learners. The Open Robot Kit seeks to enable educators to easily
  create a ‘one-size-fits-one’ robot that works with Weavly.
aboutSection:
  content: The Open Robot Kit has been working to create a guide for building a robot that can be used with Weavly, moving under the control of the program in Weavly and in synch with the character on the Weavly display. The robot will incorporate components that are affordable and easy to acquire, and can be built without extensive specialist knowledge or skills; for example, using just a screwdriver instead of soldering.
