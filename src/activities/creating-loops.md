## Description

In this activity, learners will use their knowledge of sequencing to create repeated sequences, known as loops. This unplugged activity gives learners a chance to practice planning a loop without a computer by using items around them.

## Steps

* Pick three series of similar items (e.g. forks, spoons, straws, post-it notes, clothing, and loose parts).
* Use these items to build a sequence with a repeated pattern to show the learner what this activity is about.
* Ask the learner to make their own sequence with a repeated pattern.
* Ask the learner to repeat this pattern three times in their sequence.

## Tips

* Set up a large flat surface for items.
* In situations where the learner is not able to repeat the sequence, slow the pace and build the repeated sequence step-by-step with them on an one-on-one basis.

## Skill Development

* Sorting
* Sequencing
* Planning
* Pattern recognition 

## Level Up!

* Try a loop sequence with one item being used twice (e.g. spoon, fork, fork, spoon, fork, fork)
* Try this activity again with a longer loop sequence (e.g. spoon, fork, fork, straw, spoon, fork, fork, straw)
