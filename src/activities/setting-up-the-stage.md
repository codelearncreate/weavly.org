## Description

In this activity, learners explore Weavlyâ€™s world selector to set the stage. Different scenes/backgrounds set the scene for stories and adventures:

* Sketchpad
* Deep Ocean
* Space
* Landmarks
* Jungle

The different options available can inspire learners to create plans for adventure in these digital worlds. By considering the objects and/or characters, learners can create programs to make their stories come true. For example, take the submarine in the Deep Ocean background to reach the treasure chest.

Here are a few stories that you can use as a starter to get learners thinking of adventures: <https://www.education.com/game/the-missing-dragon-level-i/>\
You can find more books for this activity here: <https://www.education.com/stories/>

## Steps

* Work with the learner to pick a story and read the story together.
* Engage the learner in a conversation about identifying a beginning, a middle and an end.
* Engage the learner in creating a story and start by opening the world selector to pick a background and set the scene.
* Find items in the background that can be used to create some context for the story.
* Repeat with another background to continue or create another story.

## Tips

* Guide learners with a framework of beginning, middle, and end for their stories (i.g. starting at the top of the ocean, dive deeper in search of treasure and find the treasure) 
* Start with a very simple story that has a clear beginning, middle, and end with the least number of objects/characters and gradually build complexity (i.e. while diving deeper avoid the jellyfish and sharks on our way to the treasure chest in the Deep Ocean background)

## Skill Development

* Communication (i.e. narrative skills)
* Creativity
* Planning
* Spatial
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

Encourage learners to come up with their own story that uses multiple backgrounds in the world selector.
