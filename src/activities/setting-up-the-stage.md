## Description

In this activity, learners use Weavly’s background editor to set the stage for their story. Learners can explore different features to create scenes and change the background. Items can be added to the scene, changed in color, and resized to the learner's liking. The background editor gives options for sound effects and animation for customization as well.

Here are a few stories that you can use as a starter: <https://www.education.com/game/the-missing-dragon-level-i/>\

## Steps

* Work with the learner to pick a story.
* Read the story together.
* Engage learner in a conversation about how they want to plan a stage for that story.
* Open the background editor.
* Find items that represent the story’s context in the editor.
* Make the required modifications to those items.
* Position the items on the scene.
* Add behavior and sound to each item and indicate which of them are dynamic and which are static.

## Tips

* Start with a very simple story that has a clear beginning, middle, and end with the least number of characters and gradually build complexity.
* You can divide the story into multiple phases. As the story progresses, learners can reopen the editor and add, remove, or modify the items on their scene.

## Skill Development

* Communication (i.e. narrative skills)
* Creativity
* Planning
* Spatial
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

Encourage learners to come up with their own story, which has a beginning, middle, and end. Then, learners can use the background editor to build their story’s environment.
