## Description

This activity provides a combination of physical and on-screen experiences for learners. This is a goal-based activity, thus learners need to plan, execute and debug (if needed) to go through the maze. This activity requires collaboration and communication between learners to reach a final destination.

## Steps

* Use masking tape to build a simple maze on the floor.
* Place some of learners’ favorite toys/treats on different spots on the maze.
* Ask learner one to wait at the beginning of the maze and move only when the program announces an action.
* Ask learner two to use the Weavly coding environment to build a program to move learner one through the maze.
* Select the “Play” button and ask learner one to move based on the steps announced by the program

## Tips

* Start with straight and simple paths before introducing more complex mazes.
* You can use grid squares to build your maze as some learners may benefit from seeing the grid squares to navigate.
* Reward both learners if they successfully finish going through the maze.
* Moderator can pause the program and help learner two to fix (debug) the program if learner one starts to move off the maze.
* In addition to the audio labels spoken by the program, the moderator can speak each action block once played to reinforce the learning of directions.

## Skill Development

* Directional
* Spatial
* Gross motor movements
* Sequencing
* Planning
* Debugging
* Social skills
* Communication

## Level Up!

Once your learners are familiar with this activity, get them to make their own maze and play then play this game.
