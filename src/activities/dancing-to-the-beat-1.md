## Description

This activity can use any coding environment for a fun and interactive way to learn about directions. Any type of movement counts as dancing in this activity whether it is stepping, jumping, wheeling, blinking, head movements, or hitting a single switch.

As a starter, you can try...

For younger children:

* [Weavly Pre-built Program](https://create.weavly.org/?v=1.2&t=default&w=Space&p=DdbB11dD&c=aab&d=)
* [Dance music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwKS4b9aUeI)

For youth

* [Weavly Pre-built Program](https://create.weavly.org/?v=1.2&t=default&w=Space&p=ADad1B1b1B1b1dD1&c=aab&d=)
* [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niUaRPODJRs)[Dance music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niUaRPODJRs)

## Steps

* Select a short song or music that learners prefer.
* Use Weavly to build a sequence of actions.
* Line up your players.
* Ask them to follow each step of the program that is announced.
* Play the music and your program at once and let the fun begin.

## Tips

* Announce every step of the program as it is being played/executed.
* For longer songs, you can replay the same program.
* Try to keep the players focused on following the running program and correcting their movements.

## Skill Development

* Gross motor movements 
* Dancing
* Directions
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

Once your players are familiar with this activity, get them to write their own programs. You can also pair them in teams and make them create a dance competition.
