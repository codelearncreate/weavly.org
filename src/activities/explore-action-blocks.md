## Description

This activity helps learners explore the different action blocks available in the action block panel on Weavly. The action blocks are the building blocks for the program that can be built or coded. This exploratory activity introduces and orients learners to the two main group of action blocks:

1. Action blocks for moving your character forwards or backwards
2. Action blocks for turning your character right or leftÂ 

These action blocks allow learners to provide clear instructions to their characters to follow out their commands. Once learners are familiar with these action blocks, they can program their code on Weavly by selecting a combination of action blocks to direct their character and move them to a particular place on the scene.

## Steps

* Open the Weavly coding environment.
* Select an action block that will move the character forward and place it in the program. Press play to see the character move forward.
* Refresh and select an action block that will move the character backwards. Place it in the program, and press play to see the character move backwards.
* Refresh and select an action block that will turn the character to the right. Place it in the program, and press play to see the character turn right.
* Refresh and select an action block that will turn the character to the left. Place it in the program, and press play to see the character turn left.
* Add a combination of moving and turning action blocks to create a sequence. Press play.

## Tips

* Consider providing learners with a visual representation for left and right if directions are a challenge

## Skill Development

## Level Up!

* Before pressing play, ask the learner which direction they expect to the character will move to and end up.
* Pick a specific location (i.e. grid cell) and ask learners to create a sequence to arrive at that spot.
