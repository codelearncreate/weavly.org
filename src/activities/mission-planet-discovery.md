## Description

In this series of activities, learners build a sequence to direct their space rocket to discover different planets. The activities in the series add to the complexity of building a sequence. Learners will use a combination of action blocks to build a sequence and navigate a specific destination on the scene. To create sequences, learners can use a combination of forward and backwards action blocks at different steps, and turn right/left at different degrees. In the mission to discover each planet, learners can take the most direct path or take on a challenge by using more action blocks to increase the complexity of their sequenced path. 

Each mission has a suspected location to explore: 
Mission 1: Planet C-1
Mission 2: Planet D-3
Mission 3: Planet H-12

## Steps

* Pick the space robot under the World Selector.
* Select the “Refresh” button to set the Rocket station at A-1.
* Add a combination of Forward/Backwards and Turn Left/Right blocks to build your program to reach the listed coordinates for each mission.
* Select the “Play” button to see whether each mission is completed.
* Select the “Refresh” button to take the rocket back to Rocket station A-1 before starting a new mission.

## Tips

* Once a planet is reached, moderators can clap, play animation effects or cheer to celebrate the arrival and discovery of a planet.
* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity. If the destination is missed, pause the program and work together to debug by asking questions

  * What is the position of the planet?
  * Which direction is your rocket facing?  

## Skill Development

* Learning about directions
* Sequencing
* Debugging

## Level Up!

For more of a challenge, introduce road blocks (meteors, alien spaceships, etc.) to encourage learners to explore different paths to reach their planet.
