## Description

In this series of activities, learners build a sequence to direct their space rocket to discover different planets. The activities in the series add to the complexity of building a sequence. Learners will use a combination of action blocks to build a sequence and navigate a specific destination on the scene. To create sequences, learners can use a combination of forward and backwards action blocks at different steps, and turn right/left at different degrees. In the mission to discover each planet, learners can take the most direct path or take on a challenge by using more action blocks to increase the complexity of their sequenced path. 

Each mission has a suspected location to explore:

* Mission 1: Travelling to the Moon
* Mission 2: Mars discovery
* Mission 3: Exploration of Saturn

## Steps

* Select the "Planet Discovery" activity link above.
* Use a combination of different action blocks to build a program to move your rocket on the grid and complete each mission.
* As you build your sequence, remember that you cannot go over other planets and should avoid meteors and space rocks.
* Select the “Play” button to check if you have completed your mission.
* Select the “Refresh” button to take the rocket back to Rocket station on earth at A-1 before starting a new mission.

## Tips

* Once a planet is reached, moderators can clap, play animation effects or cheer to celebrate the arrival and discovery of a planet.
* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity. 
* If the destination is missed or player moved over other planets, space rocks, or the meteors, pause the program and work together to debug by asking questions

  * What is the position of the planet?
  * Which direction is your rocket facing?  

## Skill Development

* Learning about directions
* Sequencing
* Debugging

## Level Up!

For more of a challenge, encourage learners to explore different paths to reach the same planets.
