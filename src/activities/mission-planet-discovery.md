## Description

In this series of activities, learners build a sequence to direct their space rocket to discover different planets. The activities in the series add to the complexity of building a sequence. Learners will use a combination of action blocks to build a sequence and navigate to a specific destination on the scene. To create sequences, learners can use a combination of forward and backwards action blocks at different steps, and turn right/left at different degrees. In the mission to discover each planet, learners can take the most direct path or take on a challenge by using more action blocks to increase the complexity of their sequenced path. 

Each mission has a suspected location to explore:

* Mission 1: Travelling to the Moon
* Mission 2: Mars discovery
* Mission 3: Exploration of Saturn

![Space background including earth, moon, Mars, Saturn, a Satellite, stars, and space rocks](/assets/media/space.svg "Space background")

Moderators can use this blurb to describe the background for the players before they start their missions:

*" This background represents space with a night-like dark blue colour. In the top left area, there is planet earth with the moon located to its right. There is one meteor below the earth and there is another one to the right of the moon. In the top right, there is Planet Saturn and two aliens to the top right of the Saturn. To the bottom left, there are space rocks surrounding planet Mars. In the bottom right, we have a satellite with a meteor to the left and space rocks on top. There are space rocks in the middle of this background . "*

## Steps

* Select the "Planet Discovery" activity link above.
* Use a combination of different action blocks to build a program to move your rocket on the grid and complete each mission.
* As you build your sequence, remember that you cannot go over other planets and should avoid meteors and space rocks.
* Select the “Play” button to check if you have completed your mission.
* Select the “Refresh” button to take the rocket back to the Rocket station on earth in square A2 before starting a new mission.

## Tips

* Once a planet is reached, moderators can clap or cheer to celebrate the arrival and discovery of a planet.
* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity. 
* If the destination is missed or the rocket moved over other planets, space rocks, or the meteors, pause the program and work together to debug by asking questions

  * What is the position of the planet?
  * Which direction is your rocket facing?  

## Skill Development

* Learning about directions
* Sequencing
* Debugging

## Level Up!

For more of a challenge, encourage learners to explore different paths to reach the same planets.
