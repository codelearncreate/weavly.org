## Description

These links provide a series of activities that add to the complexity of building a program. In the initial missions, learners can only use Forward action blocks. In the following missions, learners need to use Turns at different degrees to complete their missions.

* Mission#1: \[link] 
* Mission#2: \[link] 
* Mission#3: \[link] 
* Mission#4: \[link] 
* Mission#5: \[link] 

## Steps

* Open the missions in order and only move to the next mission when you have completed the current one.
* Depending on the mission, use different combinations of Forward and Turn blocks to build your program.
* Select the “Play” button to see how each mission is completed.

## Tips

* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity.
* Once a goal is reached, moderators can encourage learners to think about other potential ways they could have tried to get to the same destination.

## Skill Development

* Debugging
* Directional
* Spatial
* Sequencing
* Planning

## Level Up!

Moderators can restrict the number of allowed action blocks in the program to encourage learners to plan the shortest path to a destination.
