## Description

In this simple and interactive game, moderators and players work together to find the correct order of events. The moderator will perform a daily routine, such as making a jelly sandwich in an incorrect order or skipping the main steps. Now, this time is the learnerâ€™s turn to save the day and tell the moderator how to correct the order of the events to complete the task.

## Steps

* Pick a daily activity that the learner is familiar with, such as making a jelly sandwich, dressing up for outside, taking a shower, brushing your teeth, etc.
* While you are performing that task, misplace one of the steps or skip it.
* Ask learners about what went wrong and how you can fix things together.

## Tips

* Try to create situations that are fun and engaging for the learner.
* In situations where the learner does not recognize the missed or misplaced step, perform the activity again in the correct order slowly and explain the correct sequence of actions and events.

## Skill Development

* Sorting
* Pattern recognition
* Sequencing
