## Description

In this activity, learners try to build a sequence to move their on-screen character from point A to point B. The path between these two points is not straight. There are roadblocks, like sharks, along the way. The character will need to stay away from these roadblocks. While building a sequence, learners will become familiar with the Weavly coding environment.

## Steps

* Select the "Hunting the sunken treasure" activity link above.
* Use a combination of action blocks to program a sequence to take your submarine to the sunken treasure chest. 
* As you build your sequence, remember that you need to move around the shark and the jellyfish and you cannot go over the coral reef.
* Select play to see how the submarine will move from the sea surface to the sunken treasure.

## Tips

* Adult moderators can show the movements to help learners understand the purpose of the activity.
* Once the treasure chest is reached, moderators can clap, play animation effects or cheer to celebrate the arrival and discovery of the sunken treasure.
* When the built sequence is incorrect, moderators can pause the program and encourage learners to find a way to fix (debug) their program.

## Skill Development

* Debugging
* Directional
* Planning
* Spatial
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

Moderators or learners can adjust the placement of the submarine, sunken ship, and the sharks to encourage building different program combinations.
