## Description

This is a multi-level activity that starts simple and builds in complexity. Learners will build a sequence using different actions to help their on-screen character complete different missions and visit different animals on the scene.

## Steps

* Select the "Jungle Safari" activity link above.
* Choose an animal you want to visit.
* Use a combination of different action blocks to build a program to move your character on the grid and reach your selected animal.
* As you build your sequence, remember that you cannot go over the trees, bushes, and the pond. And you have to stay away from the crocodiles. 
* Once your program is ready, select the “Play” button to run the program and view how the on-screen character completes each step of the activity.
* To visit another animal, select the “Delete” button to delete your current program.
* Start building a new one.

## Tips

* Start simple and encourage learners to begin the activity by visiting either the giraffe or the lion.
* Once the learner completed the simple missions, encourage them to visit the pelican or the hippo. 
* If learner builds a program that makes their on-screen character go over the trees, bushes, or the lake, or hit the crocodiles, adult moderators can pause the activity and talk with them about how to debug their program. 
* Once a goal is reached, moderators can encourage learners to think about other potential ways to get to the same animal.
* Moderator can play the sound of animal once the learners complete a mission to celebrate and add excitement.

## Skill Development

* Planning
* Directional
* Spatial
* Sequencing
* Debugging

## Level Up!

Learners can create their own program to add a specific challenge to their mission. An example would be avoiding quick sand in their jungle safari adventure.
