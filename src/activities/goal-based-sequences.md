## Description

This multi-level activity starts simple and builds in complexity. Learners will build a sequence using different actions to help their on-screen character complete different missions and visit different animals on the scene.

* Jungle Safari Adventure: [Activity link](https://create.weavly.org/?v=0.9&t=mixed&w=Jungle&p=&c=abb&a=123456ABDabd)

Moderators can use this blurb to describe the background for the players before they start their adventure:

*" This background shows a Savannah with light beige and sand colours. In the top middle, there is a giraffe with its baby. At the top right corner there is a lion roaring on top of a cliff above the horizon. In the middle of the background, there are bushes and trees. In the lower middle, there is a pond. There are two crocodiles on the left of the pond. There is a hippo drinking water on the right of the pond. And there is a flamingo wading in the middle of the pond. There are bushes on both bottom right and left corners of this background. Your on-screen character is a Jeep. "*

## Steps

* Select the "Jungle Safari" activity link above.
* Choose an animal you want to visit.
* Use a combination of different action blocks to build a program to move your Jeep on the grid and reach your selected animal.
* As you build your program, remember that you cannot go over the trees, the bushes, and the pond. And you have to stay away from the crocodiles. 
* Once your program is ready, select the "Play" button to run the program and view how your Jeep completes each step of your sequence.
* To visit another animal, you can follow these two steps to start fresh: 

1. Select the "Delete" button to delete your current sequence in the program area. 
2. Select the "Refresh" button on your scene to move the Jeep back to its original starting point.

* Now you are ready to build a new program.

## Tips

* Start simple and encourage learners to begin the activity by visiting either the giraffe or the lion.
* Once the learner has completed the simple missions, encourage them to visit the flamingo or the hippo. 
* If the learner builds a program that makes their on-screen character go over the trees, the bushes, or the lake, or hit the crocodiles, adult moderators can pause the activity and talk with them about how to debug their program. 
* Once a goal is reached, moderators can encourage learners to think about other potential ways to get to the same animal.
* Moderator can play the sound of animal once the learners complete a mission to celebrate and add excitement.

## Skill Development

* Planning
* Directional
* Spatial
* Sequencing
* Debugging

## Level Up!

Learners can create their own program to add a specific challenge to their mission. An example would be avoiding quick sand in their jungle safari adventure.
