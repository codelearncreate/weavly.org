## Description

In this activity, learners use the Weavly scene as their virtual drawing canvas. Learners can use directional navigation in a coding environment where the action blocks and pen toggle feature enables learners to draw a design and create a patterned motif.  The process of creating various drawings and patterns on the scene encourages the use of directions and enables free-form creation. The interactive and visual component encourages learners to develop a sense of direction when using Weavly, identify cause and effect as well as inspire creativity in their coding creations.

Some example of drawings/designs created into patterned motif:[\

## Steps

* Open the drawing canvas in the Weavly coding environment. 
* Ensure the pen toggle feature is on.
* Explore and use 3-5 action blocks to create a sequence for a design/shape. 
* Refresh and move your character to the middle of the scene. 
* Press play to draw your design/shape.
* Ask learners to play their coded sequence 5-10 times to create a pattern.

## Tips

* After a design or shape has been created, ask learners what the shape they would picture before playing their sequences several times.
* Moderators demonstrating this activity first and showing learners how to use different tools to make some basic shapes can help learners with little to no coding experience.

## Skill Development

* Spatial
* Sequencing
* Directional skills
* Creativity

## Level Up!

* Ask learners to replace and/or action blocks in their sequence using the action panel
