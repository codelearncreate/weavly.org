## Description

In this activity, learners use the Weavly scene as their virtual drawing canvas. Learners can use directional navigation in a coding environment where the action blocks and pen toggle feature enables learners to draw a design and create a patterned motif.  The process of creating various drawings and patterns on the scene encourages the use of directions and enables free-form creation. The interactive and visual component helps learners identify cause and effect as well as inspire creativity in their coding creations.

Some example of drawings/designs created into patterned motif[[](https://create.weavly.org/?v=1.4&t=default&w=Sketchpad&p=sA9sA11B111Bz&c=aabffhdhdeaeaecechchcfafacdcdededeaeaccccfffffdfdcdcdefefhchcfcfcffffhdhdea&d=&s=aab)](https://create.weavly.org/?v=1.4&t=default&w=Sketchpad&p=sA9sA11B111Bz&c=aabffhdhdeaeaecechchcfafacdcdededeaeaccccfffffdfdcdcdefefhchcfcfcffffhdhdea&d=&s=aab)

## Steps

* Open the Weavly [coding environment](https://create.weavly.org/?v=1.4&t=default&w=Sketchpad&p=&c=abb&d=&s=abb). 
* Ensure the pen toggle feature is on.
*   Add a loop action block to your program. Refresh and move your character to the middle of the scene. 
*   Add a few different action blocks inside your loop. Press play to draw your design/shape.
*   In the loop number field, adjust the number of times you want this program to be repeated. (Choose a minimum of 3 to be able to notice the effects of a repeated pattern)

## Tips

* Ask learners to use the arrow keys on the right panel in the Weavly coding environment to move their on-screen character to the middle of their scene (for example cell E4). So it has more room to create a drawing. 
* Modelling this activity first and showing learners how to use different action blocks particularly the loop block can help learners with little to no coding experience to participate.

## Skill Development

* Spatial
* Sequencing
* Directional skills
* Creativity

## Level Up!

* Ask learners to replace and/or action blocks in their sequence using the action panel
